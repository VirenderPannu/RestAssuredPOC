# Rest Assured POC
1. Before running any test case start fake json server (server JSON file placed in fakerserver package)
   - npm install -g json-server
   - json-server --watch db.json
2. Here we have used Cucumber BDD + RestAssured BDD both (just to show the diff way of automation) 
3. For authentication of server requests, please follow the following link:
